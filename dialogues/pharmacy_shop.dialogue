: You enter the pharmacy with the strange plant in your hands.
: There’s an herbal scent in the air and you see a disheveled looking, elderly apothecary who comes to you with a friendly smile on her face.
Anne2: Hello! How may I help you?
: I was asked to deliver you something. I’ve never seen this kind of plant before. What is this called and what is it used for?
Anne2: Oh, thank you! This is called mint and it’s mostly used in herbal teas. It’s a great remedy for many ailments like indigestion or nausea.
: I do enjoy a good herbal tea.
Anne2: So do I. Thank you again for delivering the mint.
Anne2: I’ve been expecting Brian, the local shopkeeper, to deliver some for me but I suppose the richer you get, the more arrogant and proud you get as a side effect.
Anne2: Perhaps I’m too poor for successful people like him to socialize with me.
: Actually it was Brian who asked me to deliver it to you. It was a favor in exchange for food. I heard there was some disagreement between you. If I may ask, what happened?
Anne2: Well, things have been going pretty bad here in the village and some people, who would be in the position to do something about it, don’t care enough to do it.
Anne2:  The people are so sick I can barely get enough herbs to brew medicinal potions to help them. And most people are so poor they can’t afford the medicine they’d need.
- Surprised
	: Really? I thought this village was doing so well, judging by how busy the marketplace was.
	Anne2: Yes, sad but true. Everything is not always what they seem, my dear.
- Sad
	: I’m sorry to hear that..
	Anne2: Yes, I’m sorry too, my dear. It’s sad to see how bad things are in the village.
- Doubtful
	: But everything seemed to go just fine at the marketplace…
	Anne2: Yes, that’s what everyone would like to think, of course. But did you actually see anyone buy something?
	Anne2: Poverty is very real and very much a problem.
