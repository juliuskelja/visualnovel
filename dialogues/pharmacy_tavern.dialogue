: [speed=0.5]Determined to remember both things Dino asked you to bring him, you enter the Apothecary.
: [speed=0.5]There’s an herbal scent in the air and you see a disheveled looking, elderly apothecary who comes to you with a friendly smile on her face.
: [speed=0.5]She notices you and gives you a friendly smile.
Anne: Hello! How may I help you?
You : I’m fine, thank you. I came on behalf of Dino. He needs White Willow Bark and Marshmallow Root.
: [speed=0.5]She gives a worrying frown.
Anne: Again? He has been using it a lot this past month. Is he alright since he didn’t come himself? And where do you know each other? Sorry, but I haven’t seen you around before.

- New in town
	You: I haven’t been around for long. We met in the tavern and talked, so I’m helping him out.
	: [speed=0.5]She smiles, although seemingly surprised hearing this.
	Anne: That’s very kind of you.
- Local
	You: Oh, I’ve always lived here. I just haven’t come here in the apothecary before. I’ve known Dino for years.
	: [speed=0.5]She frowns.
	Anne: I see. I guess that explains why I haven’t seen you around much.
: [speed=0.5]She looks visibly concerned.
Anne: Dino’s a good person, of course. I’m just not sure how long I can keep giving White Willow Bark to him.
Anne: Marshmallow Root is something I won’t be giving you. He doesn’t need it, just another addiction on top of alcohol, of course.
Anne: I can barely make the ends meet and get herbs to brew the medicines with how expensive the herbs have become with all the taxes.
Anne: And I’m not the only one having trouble being able to pay the taxes. Most of Harmony Village lives in poverty and sickness.
You: Really? The marketplace seemed so busy I thought the people were doing alright.
Anne: Everything is not always what it seems, my dear. Here is the White Willow Bark for Dino.
You: Thank you!
: [speed=0.5]Even if concerned she gives you a slight smile and waves at you as you run back to the door with Dinos items in hand.
Anne: You’re most kindly welcome. Have a nice day!
: [speed=0.5]You decide you head straight back to the tavern.
